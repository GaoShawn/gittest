Recently, I am reading a book call "The Top of the Wave" written by docter WuJun. In this book, he mentioned cloud computing in the penultimate chapter. As far as I am concerned, this may be a gesture telling us that the future of computer science belongs to cloud computing.
With the development of cloud computing, lots of internet companies in China such as Alibaba, Sina have paid more attention to this field. Aliyun is drawing more attention, and SAE of Sina has a increasing number of users. As we all know, computation is just a sevice in the field of cloud computing where the data center with abundant super computers are responsable for computing and the clients access the resource via network. In order to use the server efficiently and serve more users, virtualization which can make one server run multi-os or programs in isolation is proposed. Actually, the virtual technology has been used in our life, for example, VM is just a usage of this technology.
Virtualization is a technology that partitions and combines the computer resources such as CPU, memory etc to make them look like a integrate computer. There are many virtual technologies including Hypervisor, Docker and so on.
